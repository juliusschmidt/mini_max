# mini_max
In this project I tried to understand the mini max algorithm by using it on a tic tac toe game. I pretty much copied it from this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ but made it in Python. I then tried to learn how to prune it so that I can try and use it on more advanced games like four accross, but I've been busy with work so I haven't had time. Currently the pruning does not work...
